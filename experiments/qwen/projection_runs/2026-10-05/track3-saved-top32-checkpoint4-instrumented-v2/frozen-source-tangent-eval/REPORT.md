# Source-derived near-boundary rail diagnostic

Coordinates and source tangent use only the original source. The older generated-corridor evaluator is unchanged. Feature extraction is not a quality pass.

| Image | extraction | local tangent difference deg | endpoint dx px | last4 median dx px | invalid reason |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | feature-extracted | 0.34 | -2.09 | -0.97 |  |
| consistency4 | invalid-feature | invalid | invalid | invalid | fewer than three strong edge rows immediately before source |
| derivative4 | feature-extracted | 0.18 | -2.37 | -1.65 |  |

A local edge/post can fool this source-correspondence prior. Yellow selected generated ridge, purple separated alternative, green original ridge, grey source-derived search corridor. Markers outside each crop identify y320. The untouched image remains decisive; metrics do not imply success.
